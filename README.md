# public-de-poche
My first repo, hopefully my first ruby on rails web app 

# the project
This project is meant to be a serious game for getting better at powerpoint presentations.

# About me
I started my coding career as a RoR dev and now that I have the freedom to code again, I wish to come back to my roots and give this project a shot with my favourate language, Ruby.
